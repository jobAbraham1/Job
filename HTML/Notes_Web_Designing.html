 Select the size of the fonts from Google and paste the link in the markup right under teh title
 Go to css style sheet and add font-family for the body element.
 Go to the mark up add few headings and a paragraph element and test what we have done so far.
 TRICK:: h${Heading $}*4
 Check the color of the paragraph and headings. 
  Add a color element for fonts from the root element in the style sheet for heading and paragraph seperatly
  Add font size for each eleemnts like html,body,h1-h6 as required in rem unit
